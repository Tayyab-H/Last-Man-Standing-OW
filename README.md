# Last-Man-Standing-OW
This is a repository for the overwatch gamemodes: Last man standing and Loot'n'shoot. 

**Loot 'n' shoot.** Pick up items and blast your way to victory. **20** Unique items of **4** rarities - Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary. Kill your opponents, get loot and defeat the competition! First to 35 kills wins!

**Last man standing** changes things by gives you a few rounds to loot up and rack up kills before dropping everyone into the perma-death round. When you die you're out and with a zone coming in quick, you don't have time to mess about.
